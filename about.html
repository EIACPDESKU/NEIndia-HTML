        <p align="justify"><strong>Formerly housed in the Department of Environmental Science, ENVIS RESOURCE PARTNER has been rebranded as the Environmental Information, Awareness, Capacity Building and Livelihood Programme (EIACP) on Environmental Biotechnology. The centre has since moved to the S.N. Bose Innovation Building at the University of Kalyani. The Ministry of Environmental, Forest & Climate Change, Government of India, funds the ENVIS Centre for Environmental Biotechnology at The University of Kalyani in Nadia to fulfil the job of spreading information on many environmental-related subject areas. Environmental biotechnology, a new topic that is crucial to environmental management, hasn't been covered by the network, despite its importance. 
It is consequently suggested to establish an ENVIS Centre on "Environmental Biotechnology,” with an emphasis on the management of natural resources, the reduction of pollution, and the management of hazardous waste. The database will have a strong emphasis on “Pollutant Biodegradation” and related topics.
The West Bengal Legislative Assembly founded the University of Kalyani as a premier institution of higher learning in the year 1960. Initially designed for agricultural studies, the institution has added departments for science, commerce, social science, physical education, humanities, engineering, and management to support other academic endeavours.
